This week, I used AI to help me understand my psychology and astronomy notes. I asked AI to explain concepts like classical and operant conditioning and to give examples for practice problems. I also used it to help organize ideas for assignments and discussion posts. I tried both ChatGPT and Claude and noticed they explained things in different ways, which helped me see the material from different angles. Using AI this way made it easier to focus on the parts I didn’t understand and to plan my work. I did not use AI to complete assignments, just to help me study and think through ideas. I also learned that I need to double-check the information AI gives me because it’s not always perfectly accurate.
