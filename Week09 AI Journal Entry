During this week, I was reading about inheritance in Python and building class hierarchies. I used AI to learn how to design is-a relationships and specialize methods using the super() method to add specific behavior without breaking the base functionality. The examples I practiced with were RaisedBed and ContainerPot, which extended the basic classes by adding new methods. AI also helped me plan git branching strategies for collaborative coding. I have learned how to apply design principles like preventing redundancy and allowing new classes to be derived without modifying existing code. Also, how to balance levels of abstraction in hierarchies to make them more natural and extensible. AI helped me to control architecture while coding and learning, using concepts to apply inheritance patterns with high effectiveness and a low level of control
