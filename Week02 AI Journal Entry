Week 2
This week, I used a bit of AI a lot while working on my library assignment projects in Python. I used a little bit of AI to clarify the topics, such as conditionals, loops, and basic list operations, and explanations for particular conditions, such as book availability check, availability toggle, and count of already issued books, and report generation from parallel lists. I did not use any AI to solve the exercises or edit/swing my code, but concentrated on using logic and learning things using AI for me.
AI was used to craft complex exercise strategies, including merging two shelves, looking up the first available book, and creating an availability report. I explained to AI that I’m solving the ’n’th task on the exercises, and AI gives help in the form of the best strategies to code. Later, as a result, I can view the steps of the loops and conditions clearly with the help of an AI-generated solution, and I was more confident in writing code and able to verify more easily.
I also tried out some alternate suggestions of AI as to different ways to solve particular operations, which include AI feedback, such as node node-based way, a list method-based way for the same operation. So, after that, I figured out that the same operation can be performed using multiple methods, and that was really a great experience to learn how we can implement certain things from different methods.
In general, the use of AI this week improved my comprehension of Python and reasoning tasks, and corrections gave me an insight into how to solve more advanced AI assignments. Finally, I learned that while it is essential to take heed of the AI’s suggestions and recommendations, it is even more important to critically evaluate whether they are appropriate or not, and this skill is also very important in allowing me to persist in solving the remaining AI by my own method.
