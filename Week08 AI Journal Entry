This week was spent once more using AI to support my coursework and project work. I used AI to draft my reflection in a structured way, which was later used to provide suggestions for writing emails and making a decision. The AI suggested rephrased sentences to improve clarity and organized sentences to make it easy to read a paragraph. I also asked the AI to simplify complex theories related to usability analysis so that I could explain them to others meaningfully in my class presentation. My project group used AI to brainstorm ideas, organize tasks, and draft sections of our final report. I shared the AI chat links in the group to ensure that everyone was on the same page and to keep the discussion transparent. In my free time, I experimented with different AI models to observe how the model differs in their replies to the same prompt command. I learned how AI’s language understanding depends on one prompt and how biased AI models result in biased outcomes. I am using this learning to frame the query more carefully for an accurate response. The exported AI chat link you received: AI has helped me get started on projects, prepare for class, and offer project support. However, I ensure that all efforts are my own after using AI, which significantly helps in brainstorming and project support. Adopting this new normal method has brought a balance between my aims of learning and being productive.
