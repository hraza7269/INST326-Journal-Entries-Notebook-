This week I used AI in the exercises to help in understanding Python concepts that are delegated, getters and setters, and how the @property decorator is used. I used it to get explanations and examples, but I didnâ€™t use AI to do or debug the exercises.
My team also used AI to help clarify on the project what we are supposed to do on the project and to make sure that our goals for the project are specific and realistic. It also made us come up with a common idea and task delegation. Using the AI in this manner made our group discussions to be in organized. I also learned how changing the prompt structure drastically influences the nature of the response.
I also thought about how a different AI tool would help decrypt technical material. I noted that some provided more of a theory on how to solve the given problem compared to an explanation. It helped me learn how to ask better questions and pick the perfect tool to use. In summation, using Technical AI made me learn in a charitable situation while championing understanding and not achieving better results.
