Week 7. AI was the primary introduction/assistance I used to learn proper exception handling and the basics of testing in Python. In my case, I sought information on how and when to use try/except/else/finally blocks, how to define and raise exceptions, as well as how to write and run basic unit tests with the unittest module. The system helped me out with things like how to raise exceptions within class methods (used my own example) and structuring test cases with arising expectations. Also, while dealing with exceptions, Lossword helped me generate an introduction for the library management system post required for Cybersecurity. Lastly, the experience of using AI to assist me with learning something rather than with the completion of the assignments themselves gave me an idea of creative confidence. It is all a matter of how I approach AI. It surely sat with me, helping out my skills this week, along with other examples and some explanations, of course.
