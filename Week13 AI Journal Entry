During this week, my main use of AI was to automatically assist in reviewing and polishing my final project and preparing for the end of the course. I used the generated exercise to check that I understood the recap concept: inheritance, composition, and architectural trade-offs, so that I could make sure that my final design met the course goal of flexibility and maintainability. Additionally, I asked GPT-3 to look through some code structure and make suggestions for minor refactors to improve readability and reusability, while I made all final design/coding decisions myself.
I asked GPT-3 to help me come up with brief and specific bards in the areas draft documentation to explain why I chose the is a and has a relationships, the design choice supports future changes. The suggested idea also helped me organise my final write-up and presentations by transforming my notes into bullet points/large headings.
