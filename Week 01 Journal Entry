Week 1
This week, I used AI in doing additional Python exercises in the Library Management Project to experiment with explaining basic concepts: variables, conditionals, loops, and list operations. In most places, I used AI in showing the steps and how to fix code, such as in exercises: book is in the library, toggle a book’s status, and create simple reports. I didn’t use AI to complete the exercises, and not for debugging my code either.
Another thing that I did this week was try to use AI in developing a plan for handling more complex exercises, such as joining two shelves and getting the first available book. This forms an idea of how loops and conditional is constructed while solving a problem before applying it to my code. I found that AI sometimes shows two different methods of solving a problem; in this case, I have to assess both solutions and choose the one that is most suited for this project.
Overall, AI helped me in learning more about Python programming, which improves critical thinking, and provides me with various ways to solve a problem. I learnt that it’s important to assess AI suggestions insensitively, which uncovers more problem-solving methods for future exercises.
