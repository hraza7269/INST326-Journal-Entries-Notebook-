The past week was spent mastering composition patterns and balancing has a relationship to inheritance is a relationship in Python. With the help of AI, I learned how and when to use composition over inheritance to create flexible and maintainable systems. I implemented the design of the Cell class as a composition that allows powerful changes when required.
AI explained architectural trade-offs to me, and when in development, which scenarios to use composition for, has a relationship or inheritance for is a relationship. I practiced delegation patterns using AI to instruct each object on how to interact with other objects without knowing their internals. Professional software design principles were easier to master with the help of AI.. The tooling made me write really easy, testable, and clean code without any magic, leveraging inheritance and composition the best way possible.
